# uclid

This is a project ot test my code consistency and maintenance at a medium scale level.
Uclid is a project that helps users test their maths skills and see how many simple arithemetic problems they can answer correctly in one minute.
I faced a few challenges during this project and I believe it could still be scaled for better.
